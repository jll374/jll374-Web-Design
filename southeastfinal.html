        <h2>Vietnam, Cambodia, and Thailand </h2>
          <img src='images/southeastwidefood.jpg' class='food' alt='Street Food'> <p> I had three weeks to see Southeast Asia without much of a plan. I booked a flight into Ho Chi Minh, Vietnam,which is also known as Saigon. Saigon was the capital of the French colony of Cochinchina, but in 1976 Saigon merged with the surrounding Gia Dinh Province and broke away from the Franch. It was during this time that the Vietnamese officially renamed Ho Chi Minh City after the revolutionary leader Ho Chi Minh.  Although Ho Chi Minh is it's offical name, you will still see hotels and resturants refering to the area as Saigon. </p> 

         <p>Both Hanoi and Saigon are filled with scooters and motorcycles, so getting around to sitesee through city takes some skill. Seems like most of the city doesn't have lights, so people have just mastered walking slowly at intersections and drivers adjust around the walkers. It has a similar feeling to breaking into a school of fish.</p><img src='images/southeastwidebikes.jpg' class='bikes' alt='City Bikes'>

         <p> Next stop, Cambodia! I took a small plan from Hanoi to Siem Reap, Cambodia to see the Angkor Wat temples. Angkor Wat is the largest religous momument on earth, is a World Heritage Site, and is listed as one of the 7 wonders of the world. Walking around these temples feel like you are part of an Indiana Jones movies and you are about to find a hidden treasure. The main temple is very crowded but as you start to visit the other temples you can wonder around with only a few people in sight.</p>

    <h3>Thailand: Similan Liveaboard Over Christmas </h3>	
    <p> Traveling solo over the holidays does not have to be a lonely experience.  I was traveling by myself in Southeast Asia over the holidays in 2015, but I wanted to spend Christmas day feeling part of a community. My solution was to book a week long scuba diving trip on a liveaboard boat in the Similan Islands. </p> 
 
    <p> There are a bunch of companies that run dive trips out to the Similan Islands.  I booked mine through <a href = 'http://wickeddiving.com/wd-liveaboards/similan-liveaboard/' target='_blank'> Wicked Diving </a>, which is an ecologically friendly company for budget travelers. They run both 3 day and 6 day scuba diving expeditions on a regular basis.  Since the cost of the trip was not shocking, I was able afford the 6 day trip that had me out at sea over on Christmas day. </p>

    <p> Over the week I was able to see an array of marine life. Usual spotting include <b> Giant Moray Eels, Bumphead Parrotfish, Cuttlefish, Longfin Bannerfish, Nudibranches, Ornate Ghost Pipefish, Turtles, and Manta Rays. </b> </p>
